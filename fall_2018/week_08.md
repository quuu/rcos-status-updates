## Last Week's Accomplishments

SHUTTLES DISPLAY WORKS!!!! 

Merged into master.

Able to display shuttles initial position based on update data endpoint.

Clean way without use of writing to extra files or need of separate map API.

Reviewed 2 pull requests about the front end and toggling the routes.

Tried out different map frameworks, decided to stick with MapBox.


## This Week's Plan

Get a timed function to work to move the vehicles every n amount of seconds (update
refresh). 

See if there's a way to connect the iOS app to the web app's admin portal for 
turning on late night/ inclement weather routes... otherwise figure out how to/when to
display inclement weather route.

## Anything Blocking?

The issue with layers in XCode projects. Once a layer has been added, not good enough to
simply re-add a layer with the same name. Must reference it and edit it or remove it
and then add it back with updated information... hard to get a layer once added to 
source.
