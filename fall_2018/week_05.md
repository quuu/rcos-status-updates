## Last Week's Accomplishments

General project:

Wrote a script to parse the schedules into a nice JSON format

Easily readable and now a way to be able to go from time to time iteratively





Mobile project:

Played around more with UIWebView to displaying PDF's.

Now with a JSON file of the schedule, I can utilize UITextView instead





## This Week's Plan

Try out different Swift views now that I have a PDF, Excel, and JSON format of the schedule.

See which one is the easiest to read, which one can be highlighted for current times,

which one is the easiest to expand upon.


## Anything Blocking?

Just homework, and the fact it's hard to utilize outside files for an XCode project.
