## Last Week's Accomplishments

FIRST PULL REQUEST AND MERGE IN THE PROJECT WOOOO

Finished parsing routes from datafeed, Route class is easily accessible and 
follows the same format that the web app does 
(got the class variables for each route from the web app documentation)


## This Week's Plan

Get started on parsing the other data/ fine tuning the Route class. 
Currently using a lot of Objective-C syntax, want to use more modern Swift syntax.

Maybe start looking at how to display the data I parsed on the front end map

Think of new ways of data storange, finalize what should be temporal 
and what should be permanent storage.

Do some documentation,

Assign issues in github,

Import some bots to automatically test merge conflicts and make administration better.



## Anything Blocking?

Nah, made a lot of progress and even finished the first task.
