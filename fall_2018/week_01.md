## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Got actually started on the iOS app.

- Read lots of documentation on how Swift processes JSON
  - How to make GET requests
  - Classes in Swift

- Getting familiar with Swift and XCode in general



## This Week's Plan

- Create proper objects for Routes class.

- Parse information from shuttles.rpi.edu/routes

- If finish with parsing routes information, move onto helping with integrating the information into the front end.

- Establish what should be temporary and what should be permanent:

Initial draft on above:


Permanent:
	Vehicle tracking ID and corresponding vehicle ID
	Stops (every app open, checks to make sure no new stops are added? How else to update when more stops are added?)
	Routes (same as above)

Temporary:
	Location of vehicle
	Information about vehicle other than tracking ID



## Anything Blocking?

- Big issue with entire project: Do we keep on fetching from the web? Do we have background refresh? How do we make it BETTER than the web application?
