## Overall

Throughout the course of the semester I worked on iShuttleTracker. I started this project
with 2 others and together we built a near copy of the web-app using iOS's native 
language, Swift.

In 1 semester, I individually, and we as a team made a lot of progress on the app.

We have the view of the entire app planned out, such as the schedules and map.

I (we) was able to different data such as the vehicles saved by the web app into neat objects to use in the program.

I was able to get the vehicles to display on the map and access the vehicles directly
to update the location of it after a new pull.

We were able to explore a lot of different libraries inside of the realm of Xcode and Swift.

We collectively have about ~9000 lines of written code (not counting the lines contributed by importing a framework) done towards the project.

I personally plan on continuing this next semester until it is able to be fully used
as a substitute for the Web app.

I plan on re-factoring a lot of the front-end since it's very messy and very 
unmaintainable before the end of the semester so that next semester it'll be easier
to pick up where I left off/ where new people can contribute to.
