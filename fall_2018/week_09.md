## Last Week's Accomplishments

Worked on commenting and reviewing a HUGE pull request.

Worked on refactoring the way the front end is being displayed to make it
more dynamic for active routes and hidden routes.

Looked more into layer manipulation and how to edit the layers currently
being displayed on the MapBox Framework.


## This Week's Plan

Finish up the pull request review, get it merged into master

Understand layer manipulation and be able to update vehicle
location after updates.

Finish the front-end refactoring for dynamic-ness.



## Anything Blocking?

MapBox layers are difficult to access since they aren't a normal
struct.

Very deep class with lots to look through
