## Last Week's Accomplishments

Converted the single view application into a tabbed view for easier future expandability

Merged that change into master.

Looked into external libraries to handle spreadsheet parsing and tried to update them to
work with the newest Swift and Xcode versions


## This Week's Plan

Figure out how to use UICollectionView to create a spreadsheet view with horizontal 
scrolling to display the shuttle schedule.

Look into animation with Xcode's animateWithDuration to help with displaying a moving
shuttle.


## Anything Blocking?

Old and depracated libraries.

Apple changing their naming schemes for so many different methods (causes so many libraries
to break) >:(

Learned to use just what Apple supplies to ensure longevity
