## Last Week's Accomplishments

Successfully merged in shuttles and routes using new Map Framework!!! WOOOOOO

Resolved all conflicts with multiple changes to the storyboard in the pull
request.

Found a new task for Joe to start tackling, getting a TV display for shuttletracker.

Reviewed part of Matt's settings pull request to check the conflicts with what
we already have.

## This Week's Plan

Finish arrow rotation, figure out the best way to do so...

Try out new ways to do the shuttle annotation update so I don't wipe away
all the stops with every update


## Anything Blocking?
