## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finalized shuttle update displaying. Successfully refreshes the view 
every 10 seconds with the data found on shuttles.rpi.edu/updates.

Is there a better way to do this?

Reviewed changes on other branches to make sure no storyboard conflicts
were going to happen when we finally decide to create a pull request for all
of our progress thus far.




## This Week's Plan


Get shuttle rotation to work, get shuttle arrow coloring based on route to
work after the route displaying gets merged into master.



## Anything Blocking?



Nothing
