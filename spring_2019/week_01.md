## Last Week's Accomplishments



Last week I played around with Apple's MapKit and the differences it has compared to
Mapbox. I started looking at annotations and the layering system to get to display
the shuttles and the update information.

## This Week's Plan



This week I plan to finish implementing the shuttle displaying and doing so in a non-hacky way (that I did with Mapbox) so there's no issues of memory or addressing.

## Anything Blocking?


Having to learn a new Map framework... nothing much
